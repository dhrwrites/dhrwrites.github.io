[Ahmad Jamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Jamal) ... solo.

It's hard to believe, but in his long career (he's 89!), Ahmad Jamal has never
recorded a solo album. It surprised me, and it's what immediately drew me to
[Ballades](https://www.amazon.com/Ballades-Ahmad-Jamal/dp/B07T3NQ9NY), his
newest release.

An Ahmad Jamal recording is ... fun. His playing just makes me happy. I'm not 
exactly sure why, but something in his  expressiveness, touch and inventiveness 
is simply joyful. Jamal's musical 'outness' doesn't come from speedy runs or twisty 
time changes - it's more from the overall shape and contrast of his interpretation. 
The playing can be moody, but it's above all - to my ears - happy.

Jamal isn't as familiar to the non-jazz-nerd public as some other pianists 
(Herbie Hancock, Bill Evans, etc.) but he is known for his influence on 
Miles Davis, who loved his "concept of space, his lightness of touch, his understatement".
<small>[1]</small> To be honest, I think
it's a bit lazy to quote Miles about Jamal, because Jamal is such a great artist
in his own right, but here I am doing it too, because it helps people appreciate his 
influence, especially if they aren't jazz nerds.

[Ballades](https://www.amazon.com/Ballades-Ahmad-Jamal/dp/B07T3NQ9NY) 
is a terrific recording, with the songs ranging from originals to
reinterpretations of jazz standards. Play it as background music, or study it 
note-for-note. You'll enjoy it either way.

### Highlights


- [What's New](https://open.spotify.com/track/65nchdr9ThGXlUP9xSqXZI) is a real 
  standout for me. It's got all the expansion/contraction elements that I love 
  about his playing - in time, orchestration (single notes to those massive, 
  keyboard-covering chords), and invention (snippets of melody, abstract and percussive 
  passages, melodic wanderings - everything). 

- [Poinciana](https://open.spotify.com/track/7yVkminlVC608IGsvXMYaA) (his
  [biggest hit](https://web.archive.org/web/20081123052922/http://www.jazz.com/jazz-blog/2008/1/16/ahmad-jamal-s-poinciana-turns-50-today)) gets the same treatment, and is also worth a listen.


### Other Recordings

My other favorite Ahmad Jamal recordings are:

1. [At The Pershing: But Not for
Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Pershing:_But_Not_for_Me) 
(of course).
This 1958 recording is Jamal's big hit, and it's a great listen. 

2. [Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival
1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_Montreal_Jazz_Festival_1985).
A quartet with electric bass, drums and percussion. This is a fun recording, 
and a contrast to the 1958 (the electric bass is definitely a different sound), 
but it still swings.
