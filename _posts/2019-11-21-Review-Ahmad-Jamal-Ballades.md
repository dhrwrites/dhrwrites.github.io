Ahmad Jamal ... solo.


![ballades]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/covers/Jamal_ballades.jpg)

It's hard to believe, but in his long career, Ahmad Jamal has never
recorded a solo album. It surprised me, and it's what immediately drew me to
this new recording.

An Ahmad Jamal recording is a lot of fun. His playing just makes me
happy. I'm not exactly sure why, but I think that's a combination of his 
expressiveness, touch and inventiveness. Jamal's 'outness' doesn't come from
speedy, incomprehensible runs or twisty time changes - it's more from the
overall shape and contrast of his interpretation. The playing can be moody, but it's 
above all - to my ears - happy.

Jamal isn't as familiar to the non-jazz-nerd public as some other pianists 
(Herbie Hancock, Bill Evans, etc.) but he is known for his influence on 
Miles Davis, who loved his "concept of space, his lightness of touch, his understatement".
<tinyt>[1]</tiny> I think
it's a bit lazy to quote Miles about Jamal, because Jamal is such a great artist
in his own right, but it helps people anchor his influence, especially if they
aren't jazz nerds.

*Ballades* is a terrific recording, with the songs ranging from originals to
reinterpretations of jazz standards. [What's New](https://open.spotify.com/track/65nchdr9ThGXlUP9xSqXZI) 
is a real standout for me. 
It's got all the expansion/contraction
elements that I love about his playing - in time, orchestration (single notes to
those massive, keyboard-covering chords), and invention (snippets of melody,
abstract and percussive passages, melodic wanderings - everything). His hit
[Poinciana](https://open.spotify.com/track/7yVkminlVC608IGsvXMYaA) gets the same
treatment, and is also worth a listen.

*Ballades* is a beautiful recording that anyone can enjoy. It's easy to listen
to, but is subtly challenging, as well. Put it on as background music, or
study it note-for-note. You'll enjoy it either way.

## Other Recordings

My other favorite Ahmad Jamal recordings are:

1. [At The Pershing: But Not for
Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Pershing:_But_Not_for_Me) 
[amazon](https://www.amazon.com/At-Pershing-But-Not-Me/dp/B000002O8V)
(of course).
This 1958 recording is Jamal's big hit, and it's a great listen. 

2. [Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival
1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_Montreal_Jazz_Festival_1985).
[amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Live-Montreal-Jazz-Festival-1985/dp/B000DZIGHG)
A quartet with electric bass, drums and percussion. This is a fun recording, 
and a contrast to the 1958 (the electric bass is definitely a different sound), 
but it still swings in the same way the 1958 recording did.
